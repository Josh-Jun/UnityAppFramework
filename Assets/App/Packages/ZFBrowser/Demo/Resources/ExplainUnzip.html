	<h1>Greetings!</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold;">Extract <em>DemoBrowserAssets.zip</em> to your project folder.</p>

	<p>One thing before we start:</p>

	<p>For this demo to work, we need some files in <code>MyProject/BrowserAssets/</code>, but Asset Packages can't put things outside <code>MyProject/Assets/</code>. These files are game-local HTML/CSS/JavaScript resources.</p>

	<p>Find <code>ZFBrowser/Demo/DemoBrowserAssets.zip</code> and extract it to your project folder so it looks something like this:</p>

	<pre>
MyProject/
	Assets/
		...
	BrowserAssets/
		demo/
			DoorControl.html
			HUD.html
			....
	Library/
	ProjectSettings/
	...</pre>

	<p>Once that's done, start the demo again and enjoy!</p>

	<!--
	As a side note, we could do that automatically with a pile of code, but I think this is a good starting
	point for teaching how the system works.
