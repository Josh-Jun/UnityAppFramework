## Unified Universal Blur - URP Blur effect for Unity

Unified Universal Blur allows you to display blurred version of the screen, usually for translucent UI effects.

Currently intended use cases include (other scenarios may not work):
- UI image component with blur material, displaying blurred 3D world (Canvas set to 'Screen Space - Overlay').

Features:
- Blurs both opaque and transparent objects (make sure correct setting is selected)
- Blurs Post-Processing and any other image effect which is rendered before blur (based on render feature order)

Limitations:
- NOT able to blur other UI components


<i>Tested and working for unity versions: `2020.3, 2021.3 2022.3`</i>
